Redesign the vacuum cup to have a dual-chamber system with two separate ports and two independent vacuum zones:

**Chamber Configuration:**
1. **Outer Chamber (Vulva Zone)**: 
   - Larger chamber that encompasses the entire vulva area
   - Connected to Port 1 (Primary Luer-lock connection)
   - Provides constant baseline vacuum for anti-detachment monitoring
   - Maintains consistent seal and prevents cup detachment
   - Connected to SOL1/SOL2 valves and AVL sensor for pressure monitoring

2. **Inner Chamber (Clitoral Zone)**:
   - Smaller, centered chamber specifically targeting the clitoris
   - Connected to Port 2 (Secondary Luer-lock connection) 
   - Delivers variable vacuum patterns and air pulse stimulation
   - Isolated from outer chamber by internal barrier/diaphragm
   - Connected to SOL3 valve for pattern control

**Physical Design Requirements:**
- Maintain clear dome aesthetic from reference image
- Two separate Luer-lock ports (can be top-mounted or side-mounted)
- Internal barrier/diaphragm separating the two chambers
- Ensure proper sealing between chambers to prevent cross-contamination of vacuum zones
- Outer chamber diameter: ~80mm (vulva coverage)
- Inner chamber diameter: ~15mm (clitoral focus)
- Both chambers must be visible through transparent shell material

**Functional Requirements:**
- Outer chamber: Constant vacuum (-20 to -40 kPa) for attachment and anti-detachment
- Inner chamber: Variable patterns (0 to -60 kPa) for stimulation
- Independent control of each chamber via separate solenoid valves
- AVL sensor monitoring on outer chamber for detachment detection
