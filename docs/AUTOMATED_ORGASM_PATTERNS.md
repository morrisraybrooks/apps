# Automated Orgasm Patterns

## Overview

The automated orgasm patterns are designed to replicate natural physiological arousal and climax cycles based on observed response patterns. These patterns provide complete 5-minute arousal-to-climax sequences with intelligent anti-detachment integration and multi-cycle support.

### 🔑 Key Advantage: Active Engorgement

Unlike commercial air-pulse toys (Womanizer, Satisfyer) that only provide oscillating pressure waves, the V-Contour dual-chamber system provides **sustained vacuum for active tissue engorgement**:

| Chamber | Function | Pattern Integration |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Outer V-seal** (SOL1/SOL2) | Sustained vacuum (30-50 mmHg) for vulva/labia engorgement | Active throughout all phases |
| **Clitoral cylinder** (SOL4/SOL5) | Sustained vacuum OR oscillating air-pulse (5-13 Hz) | Switches between engorgement and stimulation modes |

**This means the V-Contour can actively induce clitoral erection BEFORE stimulation begins**, rather than relying on natural arousal. This reduces time to orgasm and ensures consistent response.

## Pattern Types

### Single Automated Orgasm
- **Duration**: 5 minutes
- **Cycles**: 1 complete arousal-to-climax sequence
- **Activation**: Single button press
- **Description**: Complete physiological progression through 4 distinct phases

### Triple Automated Orgasm
- **Duration**: ~18 minutes total
- **Cycles**: 3 consecutive orgasm cycles with recovery periods
- **Activation**: Single button press for full sequence
- **Description**: Multiple cycles with sensitivity adaptation and progressive recovery periods

### Continuous Orgasm Marathon
- **Duration**: INFINITE (until manually stopped)
- **Cycles**: Endless 4-minute orgasm cycles
- **Activation**: Single button press for continuous operation
- **Description**: Optimized endless cycling with minimal recovery periods for marathon sessions

## Physiological Phase Progression

### Phase 0: Active Engorgement (Pre-stimulation, 15-30 seconds)
**Purpose**: Actively induce clitoral and vulvar engorgement BEFORE air-pulse stimulation begins

- **Outer Chamber**: 40-50 mmHg sustained vacuum (SOL1 open, SOL2 closed)
- **Clitoral Cylinder**: 35-45 mmHg sustained vacuum (SOL4 open, SOL5 closed) - NO PULSING
- **Duration**: 15-30 seconds
- **Mode**: Constant vacuum only (no oscillation)
- **Anti-detachment**: Standard monitoring

**Rationale**: Commercial air-pulse toys skip this step entirely—they rely on natural arousal which can take 5-15 minutes. By actively engorging the clitoris with sustained vacuum, the V-Contour ensures optimal tissue erection and sensitivity from the start. This is the KEY DIFFERENTIATOR of the dual-chamber system.

**What Happens Physiologically**:
- Blood is drawn into clitoral erectile tissue (corpus cavernosum)
- Clitoral glans becomes engorged and erect
- Labia minora/majora engorge and become more sensitive
- Nerve endings are exposed and primed for stimulation

### Phase 1: Initial Sensitivity (30-60 seconds)
**Purpose**: Gentle introduction to air-pulse stimulation on pre-engorged tissue

- **Outer Chamber**: Maintains 45 mmHg sustained (keeps tissue engorged)
- **Clitoral Cylinder**: Transitions to air-pulse mode (5-6 Hz, 35% intensity)
- **Start Pressure**: 35% oscillation (very gentle pulsing)
- **Ramp Duration**: 10 seconds to 55%
- **Settling Period**: 20 seconds at moderate level
- **Variation**: ±5% gentle fluctuation
- **Anti-detachment**: Standard monitoring

**Rationale**: With tissue already engorged from Phase 0, even gentle air-pulse stimulation is highly effective. This avoids overwhelming sensitivity while building arousal on optimally prepared tissue.

### Phase 2: Adaptation Period (1-2.5 minutes)
**Purpose**: Consistent moderate intensity during body adaptation

- **Outer Chamber**: Maintains 45-50 mmHg sustained (continuous engorgement)
- **Clitoral Cylinder**: Air-pulse at 6-8 Hz, 60% intensity
- **Pressure**: 60% base level
- **Duration**: 90 seconds
- **Variation**: ±8% slow oscillation (4-second periods)
- **Anti-detachment**: Standard monitoring with seal maintenance

**Rationale**: Corresponds to the observed settling period where muscle tension decreases and body adapts to stimulation. Outer chamber maintains engorgement throughout.

### Phase 3: Arousal Build-up (2.5-4.5 minutes)
**Purpose**: Gradually increase intensity to match building arousal

- **Outer Chamber**: Maintains 50 mmHg sustained (continuous engorgement)
- **Clitoral Cylinder**: Air-pulse at 8-10 Hz, ramping intensity
- **Phase 3a** (60 seconds): 60% → 75% progressive ramp
- **Phase 3b** (60 seconds): 75% → 85% continued buildup
- **Variation**: ±10-12% with increasing frequency
- **Anti-detachment**: Enhanced monitoring activated

**Rationale**: Matches the observed period of increasing effectiveness, natural lubrication, and physical responses (squirming, head movement). Research indicates 8-13 Hz is the optimal "orgasm frequency band."

### Phase 4: Pre-climax Tension (4.5-5.5 minutes)
**Purpose**: Maintain precise positioning and consistent stimulation

- **Outer Chamber**: Maintains 55 mmHg sustained (maximum engorgement)
- **Clitoral Cylinder**: Air-pulse at 10-12 Hz (optimal orgasm frequency), 85% intensity
- **Pressure**: 85% sustained level
- **Duration**: 60 seconds (75 seconds for final cycle in multi-cycle patterns)
- **Variation**: ±8% rapid oscillation (1.5-second periods)
- **Anti-detachment**: Maximum sensitivity mode (25ms response time)

**Rationale**: Addresses the critical point where full body tension returns and precise positioning becomes essential for reaching climax. The 10-12 Hz frequency matches the 8-13 Hz involuntary muscle contraction frequency observed during orgasm.

## Multi-Cycle Adaptations

### Sensitivity Adaptation Between Cycles

**Cycle 1**: Full sensitivity progression
- Standard phase progression as described above
- Complete 5-minute sequence

**Cycle 2**: Reduced initial sensitivity
- Start pressure: 40% (higher than Cycle 1)
- Faster progression through early phases
- Accounts for reduced sensitivity after first climax

**Cycle 3**: Adapted final progression
- Start pressure: 45% (highest initial level)
- Extended climax phase (75 seconds vs 60 seconds)
- Optimized for final climax achievement

### Recovery Periods

**Recovery 1** (after Cycle 1): 45 seconds
- Pressure: 30% with minimal variation
- Purpose: Initial post-climax sensitivity reduction

**Recovery 2** (after Cycle 2): 60 seconds
- Pressure: 25% with gentle variation
- Purpose: Extended recovery for continued stimulation

**Final Cooldown** (after Cycle 3): 90 seconds
- Pressure: 20% with minimal variation
- Purpose: Complete session recovery and gentle conclusion

## Anti-Detachment Integration

### Enhanced Monitoring Modes

**Standard Mode**: Used during Phases 1-2
- Response time: 100ms
- Threshold: 50 mmHg
- Gentle correction to maintain seal

**Enhanced Mode**: Used during Phases 3-4
- Response time: 25ms (4x faster)
- Threshold: 50 mmHg
- Aggressive correction to prevent detachment during critical phases

**Gentle Mode**: Used during recovery periods
- Response time: 150ms
- Reduced sensitivity to prevent over-correction during sensitive recovery

### Phase-Specific Anti-Detachment

- **Climax Phase**: Maximum anti-detachment sensitivity
- **Arousal Buildup**: Enhanced monitoring begins
- **Recovery Periods**: Gentle mode to avoid discomfort
- **Between Cycles**: Maintains seal without over-stimulation
