# Vacuum Cup Explanation

## Overview

The vacuum cup is a dual-chamber medical device component designed for vulva stimulation with anti-detachment monitoring. It's called the **A-Contour** and is purpose-built for the female vulva anatomy, solving problems that traditional dome-shaped cups have.

## Problems with Traditional Dome Cups

- Generic dome shape doesn't match vulva anatomy
- Single chamber cannot provide both attachment AND targeted stimulation
- Closed design traps fluids (urine, vaginal secretions, ejaculate) inside
- No access to urethra or vaginal opening for simultaneous play
- Uniform suction cannot replicate localized oral stimulation sensations

## The A-Contour Solution: Dual-Chamber Design

The A-Contour uses two independent vacuum zones:

### Outer Chamber (Vulva Zone)
- **Diameter**: 80mm (full vulva coverage)
- **Function**: Anti-detachment + baseline vacuum for tissue engorgement
- **Pressure**: -20 to -40 kPa constant
- **Connected to**: SOL1/SOL2 valves + AVL (Applied Vacuum Line) sensor
- Creates peripheral seal around the vulva (labia majora/minora)
- Maintains sustained vacuum for blood engorgement of vulva and labia

### Inner Chamber (Clitoral Zone)
- **Diameter**: 15mm (focused stimulation)
- **Function**: Variable patterns + air pulse stimulation
- **Pressure**: 0 to -60 kPa variable
- **Connected to**: SOL3 valve (or SOL4/SOL5 in 5-valve configuration)
- Two operating modes:
  - **Sustained vacuum mode**: Continuous negative pressure for clitoral engorgement
  - **Air-pulse mode**: Rapid pressure oscillation (5-13 Hz) for stimulation

## Physical Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Overall dome diameter | 80mm |
| Dome height | 50mm |
| Wall thickness | 2.0mm |
| Chamber separation height | 8mm |
| Diaphragm thickness | 1.0mm |
| Port separation angle | 45° |
| Pressure rating | −40 kPa continuous, −60 kPa transient |

## Materials

- **Shell**: Clear PC/Tritan (polycarbonate/copolyester) - highly transparent
- **Seal lip**: Silicone (Shore A 10–15) for skin contact
- **Compliance**: ISO 10993 biocompatible materials, ISO 80369-7 Luer-lock connections

## Port Configuration

- **Port 1 (Outer Chamber)**: Female Luer-lock connection for SOL1/SOL2 + AVL sensor
- **Port 2 (Inner Chamber)**: Female Luer-lock connection for SOL3 pattern control
- **AVL sensor tap**: 2.0mm ID pickoff on outer chamber for pressure monitoring

## Key Differentiator: Active Engorgement

Unlike commercial air-pulse toys (Womanizer, Satisfyer, LELO) that only provide oscillating pressure waves, the A-Contour can create **sustained vacuum for tissue engorgement**. This allows:

1. **Faster arousal**: Engorge the clitoris BEFORE beginning stimulation
2. **Maintained engorgement**: Sustained outer vacuum keeps tissue engorged throughout
3. **Faster orgasm**: Optimal clitoral erection from the start
4. **Enhanced sensitivity**: Engorged tissue exposes ~8,000 nerve endings
5. **Consistent response**: Does not rely on user's natural arousal state

## A-Shape Open-Channel Design

The A-Contour's defining feature is its **A-shaped geometry** that creates an open channel for vaginal and urethral access. Unlike traditional dome cups that completely enclose the vulva, the A-shape seals around the **periphery** of the vulva while leaving the center open.

### Understanding the A-Shape Geometry

The "A" shape represents the cup's anatomy:
- **A-apex triangle**: The enclosed triangular space at the top of the "A" houses the 15mm clitoral cylinder
- **A-crossbar**: The internal diaphragm that separates the clitoral chamber from the outer chambers
- **A-legs**: The two bilateral outer vacuum chambers (80mm total coverage) that seal against the labia
- **Open channel**: The space between the A-legs for vaginal/urethral access

### Key Benefits of Open-Channel Design

1. **Vaginal Access**: The open channel between the two A-legs allows insertable toys (vibrators, dildos) to be used simultaneously while vacuum is active

2. **Urethral Access**: Enables urethral sounding or catheter play during vacuum therapy if desired

3. **Hygiene/Fluid Drainage**:
   - Vaginal lubrication drains away from vacuum system
   - Urine (if released) exits through open channel
   - Female ejaculate/squirting doesn't contaminate vacuum lines or hoses

4. **Squirting-Compatible**: Traditional dome cups trap ejaculate inside, creating hygiene issues and potentially damaging vacuum components. The A-Contour's open channel allows fluids to exit freely

5. **Easy Cleanup**: Vacuum hoses remain dry; only the cup exterior needs cleaning after use

### How It Seals While Staying Open

The A-shape creates two sealed vacuum chambers on either side:
- **Left A-leg**: Seals against left labia majora/minora
- **Right A-leg**: Seals against right labia majora/minora
- **Center gap**: Open channel between the A-legs - no seal, no suction
- **A-apex triangle**: Clitoral cylinder creates focused seal around clitoris
- **A-crossbar**: Internal diaphragm separates clitoral chamber from outer chambers

This design means the vacuum pulls the labia tissue into the A-leg chambers for engorgement, while leaving the vaginal vestibule and urethral meatus completely accessible in the center

## Anti-Detachment System

The AVL (Applied Vacuum Line) sensor monitors the outer chamber pressure. If pressure rises above an adjustable threshold (indicating potential detachment), the system opens SOL1 to pull more vacuum, ensuring the cup stays attached to the patient's skin.
