## Building the Application

### Prerequisites

Install required dependencies on Raspberry Pi:

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Qt6 and development tools
sudo apt install -y qt6-base-dev qt6-charts-dev cmake build-essential

# Install wiringPi for GPIO control
sudo apt install -y wiringpi

# Install additional libraries
sudo apt install -y libqt6charts6-dev
```

### Build Process

1. Clone or copy the project to your Raspberry Pi
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

The build script will:
- Detect the platform (Raspberry Pi vs development)
- Configure CMake appropriately
- Build the application
- Provide installation instructions

### Manual Build

If you prefer to build manually:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Running the Application

### On Raspberry Pi

The application requires root privileges to access GPIO pins:

```bash
sudo ./VacuumController
```

### Development/Testing

For development on non-Raspberry Pi systems:

```bash
./VacuumController
```

Note: Hardware features will be simulated on non-ARM platforms.

## Configuration

### Pattern Configuration

Vacuum patterns are defined in `config/patterns.json`. The file includes:

- **15+ predefined patterns** with different speeds and characteristics
- **Safety limits** and pressure constraints
- **Pattern categories** for organized selection
- **Customizable parameters** for each pattern type

### System Settings

System configuration is stored in `config/settings.json`:

- **Safety parameters** (pressure limits, thresholds)
- **Hardware configuration** (GPIO pins, SPI settings)
- **UI preferences** (display settings, themes)
- **Calibration data** for pressure sensors
- **Logging and maintenance settings**

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION** ⚠️

This is a medical device controller with safety-critical features:

1. **Always test thoroughly** before clinical use
2. **Verify all safety systems** are functioning properly
3. **Ensure emergency stop** is easily accessible
4. **Monitor pressure limits** continuously
5. **Follow proper calibration procedures**
6. **Maintain system logs** for safety compliance

### Anti-detachment System

The anti-detachment feature is **CRITICAL** for patient safety:
- Monitors Applied Vacuum Line (AVL) pressure continuously
- Automatically increases vacuum if cup detachment is detected
- Adjustable threshold settings
- Immediate response capability

## User Interface

### Main Features

- **Large Touch-Friendly Buttons** - Optimized for 50-inch display
- **Real-time Pressure Charts** - Historical pressure visualization
- **Pattern Selection** - Easy access to all vacuum patterns
- **Safety Panel** - Emergency controls and system status
- **Settings Dialog** - System configuration and calibration
- **Diagnostics Panel** - System health and maintenance

### Navigation

- **F1** - Main Control Panel
- **F2** - Safety Panel
- **F3** - Settings
- **F4** - Diagnostics
- **Escape** - Emergency Stop

### Adding New Patterns

1. Define pattern in `config/patterns.json`
2. Implement pattern logic in `PatternEngine`
3. Add UI controls in `PatternSelector`
4. Test thoroughly with safety systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied (GPIO)**
   - Run with `sudo` for GPIO access
   - Check user is in `gpio` group

2. **SPI Communication Errors**
   - Verify SPI is enabled: `sudo raspi-config`
   - Check wiring connections
   - Confirm MCP3008 power supply

3. **Qt Application Won't Start**
   - Install Qt6 development packages
   - Check display configuration
   - Verify X11 forwarding if using SSH

4. **Pressure Readings Invalid**
   - Check sensor calibration
   - Verify ADC connections
   - Test with multimeter

### Logging

System logs are written to `/var/log/vacuum-controller.log` (configurable).
Enable debug logging in `config/settings.json` for detailed troubleshooting.
