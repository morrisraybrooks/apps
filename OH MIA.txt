Mia had always been resourceful, especially when it came to funding her veterinary dreams. Veterinary college wasn't cheap, and with tuition piling up, she turned her passion for animals into a side hustle. Living in a bustling dorm with ten other girls—each navigating their own chaos of classes, parties, and late-night study sessions—Mia kept her secret operation under wraps. Her roommate, Sarah, was out for the night, along with most of the others, leaving the shared common area quiet for once.

Max, her unusually huge English Bulldog, lumbered into the room, his massive frame taking up half the space. At over 100 pounds, with a broad chest and powerful legs, he was a beast built for breeding. Mia had rescued him from a shady breeder two years ago, and since then, she'd been collecting his semen for artificial insemination sales online. Buyers ranged from backyard breeders to exotic pet enthusiasts, and the payouts added up nicely. She'd done this routine hundreds of times—milking him efficiently, sealing the vials, and shipping them out discreetly.

Tonight, though, Mia felt the buzz from a few too many beers she'd cracked open earlier while cramming for an anatomy exam. The alcohol warmed her veins, loosening her inhibitions as she knelt beside Max on the worn dorm carpet. She wore a simple tank top and shorts, her long brown hair tied back in a messy ponytail. 'Alright, big guy,' she murmured, scratching behind his wrinkled ears. 'Time to earn our keep.'

Max panted heavily, his thick pink cock already emerging from its sheath as Mia coaxed him with gentle strokes along his belly. She positioned the collection jar beneath him, her hand wrapping around his swelling shaft. It was enormous, veined and throbbing, easily as thick as her wrist. She pumped rhythmically, feeling the heat radiate against her palm. Max's hips bucked instinctively, his low growls filling the room as pre-cum beaded at the tip.

The dorm was silent except for the wet sounds of her hand sliding over his length. Mia's cheeks flushed from the beer and the familiar thrill of the task. She'd always kept it professional—clinical, even—but tonight, the haze made everything feel a little more intimate. She leaned in closer, watching as his cock pulsed harder. 'Come on, Max, give it to me,' she whispered, increasing her pace.

Suddenly, Max tensed, his massive body shuddering. The first jet of cum erupted forcefully, shooting into the jar with a splatter. Mia angled it to catch the flow, but the second spurt was even stronger—overshooting the rim and arcing through the air. Hot ropes of semen splashed across her chest, soaking into the thin fabric of her tank top, and a stray droplet landed right on her lower lip.

Without thinking, driven by the alcohol's blur and some buried curiosity, Mia's tongue darted out. She licked the warm, salty fluid from her lip, tasting the thick, musky essence. It coated her tongue, sliding down her throat as she swallowed instinctively. A shiver ran through her, surprise mixing with an unexpected rush. Her nipples hardened against the wet spot on her shirt, and she felt a warmth pooling between her thighs.

Max wasn't done. Another pulse from his cock sent more cum into the jar, but Mia's focus wavered. She kept stroking him, her free hand absently wiping at the mess on her chest—only to bring her fingers to her mouth again. She sucked them clean, the flavor lingering, bold and animalistic. 'Fuck,' she breathed, her voice husky. The room spun slightly from the beer, but this felt grounding, raw.

As Max's orgasm tapered off, Mia finally sealed the jar, her hands trembling just a bit. She had enough for a solid shipment—maybe even extra if she milked him again later. But now, with the taste still on her lips and the sticky warmth drying on her skin, she couldn't shake the heat building inside her. The other girls would be back soon, oblivious to her secret. For now, though, Mia sat back on her heels, eyeing Max with a newfound hunger. Veterinary college was expensive, but tonight, the rewards felt personal.

Weeks blurred into a routine for Mia, her secret side gig with Max becoming as ordinary as her morning coffee runs. The dorm buzzed with the usual college frenzy—girls gossiping about crushes, cramming for midterms, and sneaking in boys after curfew—but Mia's world revolved around her massive bulldog and the steady cash flow from his shipments. She'd grown complacent, almost numb to the taboo edge of it all. What started as a necessity now felt like second nature; she'd stroke Max's thick cock in the dim light of her room, collecting his loads with practiced ease, even chatting on the phone with buyers while her hand worked him over. The taste from that drunken night lingered in her memory, a quiet thrill she pushed aside during the day but indulged in fleeting thoughts at night.

To unwind from the stress, Mia turned to her drawer of sex toys, hidden under a pile of textbooks. Vibrators, dildos, plugs—she'd cycle through them after long shifts at the campus clinic, fucking herself senseless to release the pent-up tension. A thick silicone cock would plunge into her pussy while she imagined wild scenarios, her moans muffled by a pillow to avoid waking Sarah. It kept her balanced, or so she told herself, maintaining the facade of the studious vet student while her body craved more raw outlets.

One Friday night, the dorm erupted into chaos. The girls had pooled cash for a kegger in the common room, blasting music and downing shots until the wee hours. Mia joined in, laughing with her roommates—Jess from accounting, who could shotgun a beer like a pro, and Lena, the art major always sketching nudes. Beers turned to tequila, and Mia lost count after the fifth round. She stumbled back to her room around 2 a.m., Max greeting her with a lazy wag of his tail. Sarah was crashing elsewhere, leaving Mia alone with her beast.

Too buzzed to bother with clothes, Mia stripped naked, her full breasts bouncing free and her shaved pussy already slick from the night's flirtations. She collapsed onto her bed, the sheets cool against her heated skin, and passed out face-down, ass slightly raised. Max, ever attentive, sniffed around her exposed body. His broad nose nudged her thighs apart, drawn to the musky scent wafting from her core. Without hesitation, he lapped at her folds, his rough tongue dragging over her clit and dipping into her wetness.

Mia stirred in her sleep, dreams twisting with hazy images of hands and mouths on her. The licking persisted, Max's tongue working relentlessly—slurping up her juices, circling her entrance, then flicking her swollen nub. Saliva mixed with her arousal, dripping down her crack and pooling in the crease of her ass. He pressed deeper, his jowls smacking wetly as he devoured her pussy, the vibrations humming through her body.

Hours later, as dawn crept through the blinds, Mia woke with a jolt. Her eyes fluttered open, disoriented by the pounding in her head and the insistent pressure building low in her belly. She was sprawled on her stomach, legs splayed, and there—between her thighs—was Max's massive head buried in her crotch. His tongue thrust inside her, lapping greedily at her walls, coating everything in thick strands of drool. The pool of slobber had soaked the sheets beneath her ass, warm and sticky, seeping into every crevice.

'Oh shit—Max,' she gasped, her voice thick with sleep and surprise. But her body betrayed her, hips grinding back instinctively as the orgasm crested. It hit halfway, a frustrating tease—waves of pleasure rippling through her pussy without full release, leaving her clit throbbing and her hole clenching around nothing but his tongue. She shuddered, a low moan escaping as she rode the edge, her fingers clutching the pillow. Max didn't stop, his licks turning sloppy and fervent, pushing her toward completion.

Panting, Mia rolled onto her back, spreading her legs wider. The alcohol's fog made it all feel surreal, but the heat was undeniable. She reached down, guiding his snout closer, letting him feast on her dripping slit. Cum from her partial climax mixed with his saliva, the scent filling the room. For a moment, she forgot the dorm walls, the other girls stirring awake nearby. This was her world now—complacent, indulgent, and utterly unfiltered.

The shipping delays hit like a gut punch, orders piling up in the queue while Mia's collection fridge hummed with a backlog of frozen vials—too many samples, not enough buyers snapping them up fast enough. She decided to ease off the routine, letting Max's production slow naturally. It had been three days since his last release, and the massive bulldog was on edge, his usual calm demeanor cracking. Every chance he got, he'd mount her leg during their walks or when she lounged on the dorm couch, his hips thrusting urgently against her thigh, that thick red tip poking out from his sheath as he humped with desperate whines. Mia would push him off gently, laughing it off to her roommates as 'just Max being a goof,' but she felt his frustration mirroring her own disrupted schedule. He knew something was off; their rhythm was broken, and it left him pacing the room, eyes fixed on her with needy intensity.

That evening, after a long day of lectures and clinic hours, Mia finally coaxed him onto the bed beside her. The dorm was quiet—most girls out for a movie night—leaving her room a sanctuary of dim lamplight and the faint scent of her vanilla candle. She poured herself a few shots of vodka from the mini-fridge, the burn sliding down her throat as she settled against the pillows, Max curling up close, his heavy body warm against her side. The alcohol loosened her edges, a familiar buzz settling in as she fired up her laptop.

First, the bank app: balances looking solid, enough to cover next semester's tuition and a buffer for emergencies. Satisfied, she switched to Gmail, scanning emails from buyers confirming receipts and a couple of inquiries for bulk orders. Her mind drifted, idly wondering if she was alone in this hustle. Dog milker, she thought with a snort, the term popping into her head like a punchline. Were there others out there, turning pet side gigs into tuition funds? The idea made her chuckle, but then her gaze shifted to Max, sprawled asleep beside her, his breathing deep and even.

That's when she saw it—his cock, fully extended in his dreams, that veined red length throbbing slightly, the bulbous knot swollen at the base like it was begging for attention. Aww, poor guy, she murmured to herself, the vodka warming her cheeks. He definitely needed help tonight; the backup was making him restless, and she couldn't ignore it anymore. The buzz amplified everything, her thoughts veering from innocent curiosity to the pull of porn tabs she'd bookmarked, then zeroing in on that pulsing dog cock right there, inches from her hand. Heat pooled between her legs, her pussy clenching at the taboo rush.

Mia rolled onto her side, reaching for the nightstand drawer. She grabbed the collection jar, the lube bottle, and paused at the sight of the cock ring—a thick silicone band she'd bought on a whim for her toys but never used. Ewww, I remember what this is for, she thought, a shiver running through her. It stretched cocks tight, prolonging the pump, trapping the load until release. What the hell, she decided, snatching it up too, her heart pounding with reckless impulse.

Careful not to wake him, she flipped her position on the bed, scooting down so her head aligned with his hindquarters, his sheath facing her. Max stirred faintly but stayed in dreamland, his body relaxed on his back. His cock had softened a bit in the interim, retreating halfway into the sheath, but Mia wasn't letting that last. She squeezed a dollop of lube onto her fingers and gently coaxed the tip out, her touch light and encouraging. It emerged slick and warm, the pointed head glistening as she wrapped her hand around the shaft.

She started slow, rubbing the length with firm, squeezing strokes, her palm gliding up and down the veined skin. Her other hand tugged the sheath back fully, exposing every inch. Within seconds, he hardened under her grip, the cock swelling thick and rigid, pulsing against her fingers. Precum jetted out in hot spurts, splattering her chest and soaking into her tank top, but she didn't mind—didn't want it diluting the sample anyway. She let it spray freely, the warmth trickling down her cleavage as she worked him with both hands now, twisting gently at the base to keep the rhythm steady, lulling him deeper into his slumber-fuck.

Max's hind legs twitched, his breaths quickening, but his eyes stayed closed, lost in whatever fantasy her touch ignited. The knot ballooned at the root, huge and insistent, locking the pre-cum flow to thicker, more forceful pulses. His cock pumped in her fist like it was knotting her hand, the pressure building as if payback for that interrupted orgasm he'd given her nights ago. But this was different—raw, affectionate, fueled by the alcohol's haze and their shared routine. Mia's mouth watered, her own arousal dripping onto the sheets as she watched the knot throb.

Then it hit: the real cum, erupting in powerful jets that arced straight into her face. The first rope splashed across her cheek, hot and thick, the musky taste hitting her lips as she gasped. It was better than she remembered—salty, potent, sliding down her throat when she instinctively licked it off. Driven by the buzz and the sight of him so vulnerable, she leaned in closer, pressing the tip to her lips. Her tongue flicked out, lapping at the slit, savoring the fresh spurts as they coated her mouth.

Before she could think, instinct took over. Max's hips bucked in his sleep, ramming forward, and the knot shoved past her lips and teeth in one forceful thrust. It locked inside her mouth, stretching her jaw wide, the bulbous swell sealing against her tongue and palate. She gagged at first, eyes watering, but the fullness sent sparks straight to her core. His cock throbbed deep, flooding her with jet after jet of seed, pumping directly down her throat as she swallowed reflexively. Her nose pressed into his heavy balls, inhaling the earthy scent, her hands still squeezing the base to milk every drop.

Mia's pussy ached, untouched but clenching hard as she nursed on him, the knot pulsing with each wave. She hummed around it, vibrations drawing out more cum, her body rocking in place. The jar sat forgotten nearby, but this felt right—intimate, unscripted. Max whined softly in his sleep, hips grinding shallowly, knotting her mouth like she was his bitch in heat. The alcohol blurred the lines, turning necessity into indulgence, and as the last spurts filled her belly, Mia pulled back just enough to breathe, the knot still lodged, tying them together in the quiet room.

4.

Mia's pulse thundered in her ears, the knot still bulging against her inner cheeks, locking Max's slick shaft deep in her mouth as his body relaxed into deeper sleep. The bulldog's heavy breaths ruffled her hair, his balls slack against her chin, but every subtle twitch sent a fresh trickle of cum sliding down her throat. She couldn't speak, couldn't even gasp—only stare up at Lena with wide, mortified eyes that flickered with unwanted heat, her body betraying her as her pussy clenched around nothing, aching for touch.

Lena leaned in closer, her breath warm on Mia's flushed skin, that smirk widening into something predatory yet playful. 'Confession time,' she murmured, her voice a husky whisper that cut through the room's thick tension. 'I've seen you masturbate him before. Those late nights when you think everyone's asleep? The way you stroke that fat red cock of his, squeezing out ropes of cum into those jars... I thought this was going on, but I wasn't sure. Now I know.' Her eyes gleamed, dropping to where Mia's lips stretched obscenely around the knot, drool and seed glistening on her chin. 'And fuck, Mia, I have a permanent show now. Front-row seat to your little dog-milking operation.'

Mia's mind reeled, humiliation crashing over her like a wave, but it twisted low in her belly, stoking the fire between her legs. She'd been careful—or so she thought. The dorm walls were thin, the fridge in the communal kitchen stocked with her "science project" vials labeled vaguely for vet class. But Lena knew. Lena had watched. The thought made Mia's clit throb, her thighs slick with her own arousal, the wet spot on her panties spreading as she squirmed futilely against the bed.

Lena's gaze followed the movement, her tongue darting out to wet her lips before she lifted her hand, extending her index finger. Slowly, deliberately, she licked it—her tongue flat and swirling, coating it in saliva that shone in the low light. 'Don't worry, your secret's safe with me,' she purred, her free hand brushing Max's furred flank absentmindedly, making the dog rumble in his dreams. 'But this? This is too good to ignore.' Her finger trailed down Mia's thigh, pushing aside the soaked fabric of her panties with ease, exposing her dripping pussy—lips swollen and parted, clit peeking out begging for attention.

Mia's muffled whimper vibrated around the knot, sending a shiver through Max's body, but Lena didn't stop. She pressed her slick finger against Mia's entrance, circling the tight hole once, twice, before sliding it in deep—knuckling into the hot, clenching walls that sucked her greedily. Mia's hips bucked involuntarily, her pussy gripping the intrusion, juices coating Lena's hand as she pumped slowly, curling her finger to stroke the spongy spot inside that made stars burst behind Mia's eyes.

'This is a coming attraction,' Lena teased, her voice dropping to a breathy laugh as she added a second finger, stretching Mia's cunt with wet, squelching thrusts. 'Get it, Mia? Coming... like all that dog cum you've been swallowing.' She twisted her wrist, thumb finding Mia's clit and rubbing firm circles, the dual assault making Mia's body arch off the bed. The knot in her mouth pulsed in time with her racing heart, Max's cock leaking one last spurt onto her tongue as her orgasm built fast and filthy, her walls fluttering around Lena's invading fingers.

Lena's eyes locked on Mia's, dark with lust, her own thighs pressing together as she finger-fucked her harder, the room filling with the obscene sounds of Mia's soaked pussy and her choked moans. 'Bet you've been dying for this. Someone to watch you get knotted and filled. Cum for me, Mia—let me feel that tight little hole squeeze while you're tied to your big boy's dick.'



5.

The morning light filtered through the thin dorm curtains, casting a hazy glow over Mia's rumpled bed. She stirred awake, her body sore in the best-worst ways—jaw aching from the knot's relentless stretch, pussy still tender from Lena's fingers plunging deep and relentless the night before. Max snored beside her, his massive frame sprawled across the mattress, that thick red cock tucked away in its sheath for now, but the memory of it throbbing against her tongue made her thighs clench. The air smelled of sex and dog, a musky reminder of how far she'd tumbled into this forbidden routine.

Mia sat up, rubbing her eyes, her tank top twisted around her waist, panties crusty with dried cum—hers and Max's mixed in a sticky testament to the chaos. The dorm was quiet; most girls were at early classes or nursing hangovers from the weekend. She glanced at the collection fridge in the corner, vials lined up like soldiers, waiting for the next harvest. But today, her mind replayed Lena's touch: those slick fingers curling inside her, thumb grinding her clit until she shattered around the intrusion, muffled cries vibrating Max's shaft as ropes of his seed spilled down her throat.

A soft knock echoed from the door, jolting her. Before she could respond, it cracked open, and Lena slipped in, her hair tousled in a just-rolled-out-of-bed mess, wearing nothing but an oversized tee that barely skimmed her thighs. Her eyes sparkled with that same wicked gleam from last night, lips curving into a grin as she shut the door behind her. 'Morning, knot-slut,' she whispered, sauntering over with a sway that made Mia's pulse quicken. 'Sleep well after I finger-fucked you into oblivion?'

Mia's cheeks burned, but she couldn't deny the fresh throb between her legs. 'Lena... what the hell? You can't just—'

Lena cut her off with a laugh, plopping onto the bed's edge, her hand casually petting Max's head as the bulldog's tail thumped lazily. 'Oh, I can, and I did. And fuck, Mia, watching you tied there, swallowing his load while I pumped your dripping cunt? Hottest thing I've seen.' She leaned in, breath hot against Mia's ear. 'Got a wild idea to make it even better. Let me try the cock ring tonight. On him. I wanna see that fat knot swell even bigger, trap his cum longer while you milk it out.'

Mia's breath hitched, visions flashing: the silicone ring she'd used last night, cinching Max's base to keep him hard and leaking, his hips jerking as she stroked him to eruption. Now Lena wanted in? The thought sent a gush of wetness soaking her already damp panties. 'You... you serious?'

'Absolutely.' Lena's fingers trailed up Mia's arm, nails grazing her skin. 'We'll try that, okay? You handle the stroking, I'll snap the ring on, maybe even hold his balls while he unloads on your face again. Or in it.' She winked, standing up with a stretch that flashed the curve of her ass under the shirt. 'Think about it all day. I'll be back after classes—cock ring ready.' With that, she skipped off toward the door, hips bouncing, leaving Mia staring after her, heart pounding and pussy clenching at the promise of more.

The door clicked shut, and Mia collapsed back, hand slipping between her thighs to rub her aching clit through the fabric. Tonight couldn't come soon enough.
